# Open-source Enthusiast Playbook

Welcome to the [Open-source Enthusiast Playbook](#playbook)!

Here you will discover some thoughts and principles about open-source movement.
The goal of the paper is to assist you in the decision about way of participation in the open-source development.
I'll try to show you how to make process enjoyable, comfortable and beneficial for both yourself and the community.

## <a name="problem"></a> The Problem

Everything starts from the Problem. Every day we solve a lot of problems and we don't focus much on the
process until we discover some with no clue about the answer. So let's quickly take a look over common way
to fight it:

- _Research_, we try to find any existing way to treat the problem

- _Comparison_, if we found some approaches we need to choose one to apply

- _Application_, experience of approach application to your problem

- _Adjustment_, actions about some negative feedback from solution usage experience

- _Innovation_, possibility to create new approach based on your experience

Till now, we talked in general but the same is valid for open-source solutions and projects. So
you could apply that receipt to solve your problem using open-source infrastructure.

But sometimes the problem is not usual. Sometimes The Problem is just curiosity about some subject.
Then we should only focus on studing experience, not the particular application of some solution.


Summarily, we have variety of enthusiasm efforts as the input. Let's call it Problem Empathy Axis which
starts from Little curiosity and ends up with Problem Empathy.

Let's stop for a moment and switch our focus to the solution itself.

## <a name="focus"></a> Innovation Focus

Take a look at the Hype Cycle chart. It is a common path any new technology should pass to become mature and
highly adopted. More about Hype Cycle charts stages you could find in the [Maturity Model post](https://open-source-quality.github.io/2018/02/02/open-source-maturity-model.html).

![Hype Cycle Chart](/hype-cycle-chart.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Here we should emphasize the scopes of participant interest around each stage of Hype Cycle. We could name them:
- __Pioneers__ (Trigger/Hype Stage), those most interested in terra incognita and innovations, but of course at the cost of the sophistication.
- __Settlers__ (Crystallization Stage), those thrilled by making things work and creating the infrastructure to support the new problem solution.
- __Town Planners__ (Productivity Stage), those are focusing on scale and performance which is critical for high technology adoption.

So no matter what problem you're trying to solve you'll fit in one of these groups or even in several, but not at the
same time).

Back to our topic, we have a problem, and during an attempt to solve it we find several existing solutions.
Those solutions could be at the moment on different stages of maturity, and you have to choose one, at least
as a starting point.

As a clue to choose one that will be comfortable and interesting for you, I suggest picking the group
(Pioneers, Settlers, Town Planners) that you feel more comfortable in and try to assess the maturity of
the solution using [Maturity Model](https://open-source-quality.github.io/2018/02/02/open-source-maturity-model.html).
Then you just choose one of the solutions that will enjoy you the best.

Summarily, we have another axis representing our interest in innovation. It starts with the Innovation which focuses
on exploring a new field and ends with Optimization, the impulse to make solution scalable and efficient.

But wait a sec. I just chose the project, but what could I do about it? What does it mean "participate in the open-source"?

## <a name="roles"></a> Roles

Couple of words about the open-source community roles:
- [__Spectators__](#spectator-playbook) intention is thirst of knowledge and ideas. She plays important role in the problem discussions and interest propogation.
- [__End-users__](#user-playbook) intention is to get through some problem using a tool. Also, as a side product she gathers experience in the problem field.
- [__Reporters__](#reporter-playbook) intention is to provoke community to resolve some issue or extend the solution scope with some whistles. The side product here is the experience of efficient communication and forming requirements in the complex development process.
- [__Contributors__](#contributor-playbook) intention is to solve some corner case relevant to his environment. The side product is experience learnt by doing and yeilded from communication with other engineers.
- [__Maintainers__](#maintainer-playbook) intention is an attitude to find the most optimal solution to some problem critical to the maintainers environment. The side product is the ability to put together intelligent and harmonious community and maybe even find friends in a fight with the problem.

So if you've mentioned something about yourself in the description above in relation to the problem - you're half way down the road to an interesting open-source adventure.
Otherwise, I ask you to express your opinion in the issue to this project [here](https://github.com/open-source-quality/open-source-quality.github.io/issues).

Remember the Empathy Axis we've discussed? Here we could apply it, too!
At the start near the Curiosity we have Spectators role and at the end near the Problem Hyper-empathy is Maintainers role.

![Enpathy Axis](/problem-empathy-roles-axis.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Let's pack the whole together!

## <a name="playbook"></a> Playbook

![Open-source Enthusiast Chart](/playbook-chart.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Let's take a ride over the whole process. We're starting from our [problem definition](#problem), then we need to define our goal using two axis:
- [_Empathy to the problem_](#roles) and choose preferable roles
- [_Focus of innovation_](#focus) and choose preferable focus group to action

On the crossing of those you'll see where your open-source adventure could give you the best process experience.

Finally, I'll suggest some actions you could take for each combination of Role and Focus group.

## <a name="spectator-playbook"></a> Spectator Actions Suggestion
Impact of this role in community highly underestimated, as it is the entry point of whole problem area and key to the
community growth. The best exerience here could be gained by watching and analyze of the product, process and problem.
Also it is the easiest way to participate and the feedback of Spectator is pretty important to understand toxicity of
the community.

- __Pioneer__:
  - Discover innovations and share them in public
  - Analyze innovation problem field and solution demand
  - Share the analysis and your impressions about it
- __Settler__:
  - Analyze, discover and share requirements in the problematic field
  - Learn about the refactoring and quality evolution techinques
  - Discuss the team behavior and particular actions in public
- __Town Planner__:
  - Extract and discuss best practices from team collaboration
  - Learn the approaches to achieve higher quality of the solution
  - Share and discuss your impressions about it

## <a name="user-playbook"></a> User Actions Suggestion
Impact of this role critical to the project survival. Not a single project could be considered valuable without
quite enough Users involved in verification of solution.

- __Pioneer__:
  - Discover new project and try to apply it in your environment
  - Share your impressons (both successful and dissatisfying) and experience in public
- __Settler__:
  - Discover how the project evolvement impacts end-user experience and share in public
  - You could also try to apply some techinques from the solution inside your own app and share that story, too
- __Town Planner__:
  - Analyze and share how to scale using proved techinques from the projects you use
  - Share and discuss impact of optimizations in the project you depend

## <a name="spectator-playbook"></a> Reporter Actions Suggestion
Impact of this role critical for project growing. The User feedback expressed directly to the Maintainers team
shows the critical paths of your solution and gives ability to understand real boundaries of the solution.

- __Pioneer__:
  - Share your vision and experience about the problem direclty to the maintainers (e.g. in social or DM)
  - Express the ideas how to overcome the conflicts that you faced as user to the project community
- __Settler__:
  Share with the contributors:
  - pitfalls of existing requirements you faced
  - how new features and refactoring affected your own development
  - ideas how overcome those
- __Town Planner__:
  - Learn best practices about creating clear bug and feature reports
  - Share in the same way the issues about the communication process within the project

## <a name="contributor-playbook"></a> Contributor Actions Suggestion
Needless to say that Contributions is essential part of the Open-source movement. Just a few examples for you.

- __Pioneer__:
  - Earn some experience about innovative tech and trending topics by contribution. Take an attempt to fix or add a feature you find critical from your fresh point of view
- __Settler__:
  - Make some refactoring or debugging in substantial part of software infrastructure. Grow your experience about making changes safe.
  - Add the source documentation, as it is necessary for project evolution. Help project become more explicit and open for contributions.
- __Town Planner__:
  The huge variety of small contribution opportunities. The project became complex enough, so any support is welcome:
  - Docs typo fixes
  - Documentation about the problem and various how-to, wiki articles
  - Of course, you could choose an existing bug or open feature request and learn about the project by attempt to cover it.
  - As the side product, you'll learn how huge destributed team could cooperate to solve the problem

## <a name="maintainer-playbook"></a> Maintainer Actions Suggestion
The courage of the Maintainers leads us to our bright future. This role is pretty difficult to hold as time goes by you'll need
much more resources to move project forward and breathing it live. On the other hand you have a real opportunity to find
the most optimal solution, become the core of dedicated and intelligent community and also learn a lot about the problem you're trying to solve.

- __Pioneer__:
  Find some innovation. Whether it is a new field or new approach to a problem:
  - You could make a prototype just to be sure the problem has any solution
  - You could write some rational behind the particular approach
  - At least you could make research about existing soltions and summarize their issues to make sure there is a space for another approach
  - Of course, you could share the research or prototype and discuss it in public to verify and clarify the problem boundaries
- __Settler__:
  Congrats! This is an important moment for the projects future. Your efforts should lead project to it's balanced and stable version:
  - Refactor it, but learn how to make it safe
  - Create automated testing environment that will help you grow stability
  - Document your source code to share knowledge you're having in your head, fight the bus factor
  - Any other action the will improve user experience
- __Town Planner__:
  Wow! You got there. Whether you was the maintainer from the begging or was just introduced to the core team. It is exciting stage for the project.
  You already have huge users community. Now you're ready to grow the community around the problem. Encourage people to participate in your project:
  - Write clear process documentation and templates about bug reports or feature requests
  - Make sure that you meet the diversity aggrement, introduce the Code of conduct and get rid of the toxicity from your community
  - Analyze what else you could do to make your community strong, open and friendly to anyone
  - Of course, don't forget about the quality. Your core team could try to apply any known QA techinques and maybe even invent your own.


## Good luck!

#### So take your action or [suggest another one for others](https://github.com/open-source-quality/open-source-quality.github.io/issues)!
And don't forget about some introspection.


## Introspection
At the end of your journey, it's worth to look back for a moment. Think about what just happened and
what could it be the next adventure you'll take.

Open-source development is a way to unite people around same interests and problems. All the community has
the same goal to find the most optimal solution which will satisfy every member. But what's even more important,
the primary motivation here is a desire to learn about software engineering empirical way. And it is driven
mostly by curiosity, enthusiasm, and consciousness. Sometimes it quite hard to work along that route.
But no matter what you should remember: open-source should be about having fun, to be excited, not to be exhausted.

Answer several questions about how you feel about your open-source experience and, by the way, help the
project you participated in to be more accessible and open:

- Did you finish the task you've tried to solve? If it's not, why did you decide to stop?

- What I've learned from that experience?

- What I found dissatisfying in the participation process? Who and how could make that experience better?

- What communication issues did I face with the project?

- Do I want to have more similar experience in the future?

Compose a clear summary based on your answers. Add here some notes about what could fix the issues you face.
So one thing you could do is to share it with the community in the most comfortable way.
Sometimes it makes sense to create an issue or just DM to some of the maintainers in their public social.

And last thing. You _DON'T HAVE TO_ share. The introspection makes sense on its own. It is an attempt to
clarify what is your intention to be a part of the open-source community.
There is nothing wrong with any type of interaction with open-source community, as well as just leaving it,
even sometimes, without a notice)

Just remember to be an intelligent man and have fun!
